spiral-matrix
=============
The matrix starting from the middile of the matrix and travers to the right in a clock wise direction is called spiral matrix. For example a matrix starting with the number 1 and moving to the right in a clockwise direction a 5 by 5 spiral is formed as follows:
  
                  21 22 23 24 25
                  20  7  8  9 10
                  19  6  1  2 11
                  18  5  4  3 12
                  17 16 15 14 13
                  
  Note: The sprial matrix must be of X by X size where X is Odd number.
