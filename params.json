For example a matrix starting with the number 1 and moving to the right in a clockwise direction a 5 by 5 spiral is formed as follows:\r\n  \r\n                  21 22 23 24 25\r\n                  20  7  8  9 10\r\n                  19  6  1  2 11\r\n                  18  5  4  3 12\r\n                  17 16 15 14 13\r\n                  \r\n  Note: The sprial matrix must be of X by X size where X is Odd number. \r\n\r\n\r\nRequirements\r\n------------\r\n### Required\r\n\r\n- Apache Maven \r\n- Java JDK 7\r\n\r\nBuild\r\n-----------\r\n\r\nmvn clean install package && cd target && java -jar spiral-matrix-1.0.jar && cd ..\r\n\r\nFAQ\r\n---\r\n\r\n\r\nLicense\r\n-------\r\n\r\n\tCopyright (c) 2014 Suman Pal\r\n\r\n\tPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining\r\n\ta copy of this software and associated documentation files (the\r\n\t\"Software\"), to deal in the Software without restriction, including\r\n\twithout limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish,\r\n\tdistribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to\r\n\tpermit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to\r\n\tthe following conditions:\r\n\r\n\tThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be\r\n\tincluded in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\r\n\r\n\tTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,\r\n\tEXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF\r\n\tMERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND\r\n\tNONINFRINGEMENT.
