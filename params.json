{"name":"Spiral-matrix","tagline":"","body":"spiral-matrix\r\n=============\r\nThe matrix starting from the middile of the matrix and travers to the right in a clock wise direction is called spiral matrix. For example a matrix starting with the number 1 and moving to the right in a clockwise direction a 5 by 5 spiral is formed as follows:\r\n  \r\n                  21 22 23 24 25\r\n                  20  7  8  9 10\r\n                  19  6  1  2 11\r\n                  18  5  4  3 12\r\n                  17 16 15 14 13\r\n                  \r\n  Note: The sprial matrix must be of X by X size where X is Odd number. \r\n  \r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
